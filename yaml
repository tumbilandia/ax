To define a Persistent Volume (PV) and a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) for 10Gi of block storage in OpenShift (or Kubernetes), you need to specify the correct storage class and volume mode.

1. Persistent Volume (PV) Manifest
This defines a static 10Gi volume of type block.

yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-block-10gi
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  volumeMode: Block
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce  # Since block storage is often node-bound
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: block-storage  # Adjust this based on your storage class
  csi:
    driver: ocs-csi.ceph.com  # Example for Ceph RBD; adjust for your setup
    volumeHandle: my-block-volume-id  # Unique volume ID in your storage backend
    fsType: ""
2. Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) Manifest
This will request a 10Gi block storage volume.

yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-block-10gi
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  volumeMode: Block
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
  storageClassName: block-storage  # Ensure it matches the PV's storage class
3. Explanation of Key Fields
volumeMode: Block → Ensures raw block storage instead of a filesystem.
accessModes:
ReadWriteOnce (RWO) → Volume can be mounted only by a single node.
storageClassName → Defines which storage class to use (must match the configured storage backend).
persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy:
Retain → The PV is not deleted when the PVC is deleted (can also be Delete or Recycle).
csi section in PV → Needed if using a CSI-based storage provider (e.g., Ceph RBD, OpenShift Data Foundation).
Next Steps
Check Available Storage Classes:

sh
Copy
Edit
oc get storageclass
If you have a CSI-backed storage class, use it in the storageClassName field.

Apply the Manifests:

sh
Copy
Edit
oc apply -f pv.yaml
oc apply -f pvc.yaml
Verify the PVC Binding:

sh
Copy
Edit
oc get pvc pvc-block-10gi
If bound, it should show a status of Bound.
